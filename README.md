# raku-Our-TUI
Outline the key functions and variables involved in creating a Terminal User Interface, similar to ncurses, intended for xterm terminals, able to manage a base virtual window that contains frames inside.  Show me a sample implementation in the Raku language.  Add keyboard input handling, dynamic resizing, and frame focus switching.  Add mouse support, scrollable content, or interactive widgets like buttons or text inputs.  Modularize this into a reusable Raku module and add support for menus, checkboxes, or drag-and-drop.  Add support for themes, event dispatching, and layout managers.  Generate the full module and main script as downloadable files.  Add support for themes loaded from config files, keyboard shortcuts, and animation effects.  Package this into a downloadable .rakumod and sample app file.  Add support for multi-window management, modal dialogs, and internationalization (i18n).  Add support for accessibility features, touch input, and live data binding.  Add support for remote UI over SSH.

Generate a complete project structure with these features and provide it as a downloadable ZIP file.
